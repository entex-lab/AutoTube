Description :
	Though YouTube has the play list function, but people who usually want to listen a music randomly or pick up a music
	on the recommand related video in the left side list.
	So I try to do it by itself, means computer.

Usage: 
	At first, search a video/song, and select it to play on the left. It will find a relative list and choose one as the
	next playing by selfmotion. As long as the YouTube dosen't cause an error on video or your network got something 
	problems, it will be playing forever :P
	But, if the relationship diverges, means, it might find a video/song out of your search terms. This is not a bug, 
	but, I have gotten the solution.

Version 1.0.16 : 
	Start to write the readme.
